# Out of Distribution Sample Detection
This repository is the ultimate self-contained reference for **out of distribution sample detection with deep neural networks**. We keep track of:

1. The latest publications.
2. The available (open-source) implementations.
3. A comparison of the compute cost, memory requirements, and the overall effectiveness of each method.

The hope is to provide the community with a current picture of the state-of-the-art on this problem. We welcome all contributions to this repository through [pull requests](pulls). You can also discuss your ideas and thoughts on ways to improve this repository in the [issues page](/issues).
